# Netflix Data Analysis Project

### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze a dataset of Netflix shows and movies to uncover interesting insights and patterns. The dataset includes information such as show ID, type, title, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, and duration. The analyses performed in this project cover various aspects of the dataset, including distribution of content types, trends in release years, most frequent actors and directors, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes the following columns:

* 'show_id': Unique ID for each show
* 'type': Type of content (Movie or TV Show)
* 'title': Title of the content
* 'director': Director of the content
* 'cast': Cast members
* 'country': Country of production
* 'date_added': Date the content was added to Netflix
* 'release_year': Year the content was released
* 'rating': Rating of the content
* 'duration': Duration of the content (in minutes for movies, number of seasons for TV shows)
